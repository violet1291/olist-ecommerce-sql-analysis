# olist-ecommerce-sql-analysis
The objective of this project is to analyze the commercial performance of an e-commerce platform (Olist) by evaluating sales, customer spending, satisfaction and main sellers using SQL queries on a real relational dataset.

# Dataset description

This project uses the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset, a public dataset available on Kaggle that contains real transactional data from a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace. The dataset represents orders made between 2016 and 2018, including information about customers, sellers, products, payments, reviews, and logistics.

The data is organized in a relational schema, which makes it ideal for SQL-based analysis. The main tables used are the following: olist_orders_dataset, olist_order_items_dataset, olist_customers_dataset, olist_sellers_dataset, olist_products_dataset, product_category_name_translation (Translations of product category names from Portuguese to English) and olist_order_reviews_dataset.
